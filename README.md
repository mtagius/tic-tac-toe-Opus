# Tic-Tac-Toe Opus
Matt Agius

This repo is the home of a personal project called "Tic-Tac-Toe Opus" which is hosted at http://mtagius.com/tic-tac-toe

This project is a work in progress and is not ready for use.  I have been working on this to learn new skills, like using bootstrap and writing PHP however, I am also making this with the goal to be the best place to play tic-tac-toe on the web.  How hard could that be?
